 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

Due to constant evolution of software engineering, each day brings new
programming languages, development paradigms, ways of evaluating processes,
among other things. With the source code metrics does not be different, with
the passage of time arise other metrics classes and the use thereof has the
need to know how to use them. For the use of any software metric, is necessary
to have knowledge about how to perform the collection, calculation,
interpretation and analysis for decision decisions. In the context of source
code metrics, collecting and calculating most often are automated by tools, but
how should we monitor them during the software development cycle? This work
aims to assist the Software Engineer to monitor metrics of vulnerability
threats of source code through a reference prediction model, considering that
increasingly softwares have security non functional requirements, which leads
to the need to know how monitor these requirements during the software
development cycle.
